# Game_SketchPrototype
*This is now a prototype for a second version that is currently being designed and developed.

Sketch is a 2D game that takes place in a classroom. The goal is to collect a variety of gifts to give to your crush at the top of the class in order to woo her - but don't get caught. Get caught three times and you’ll get detention! Successfully fill the swoon meter however and you’ll get the girl!

Sketch was a solo project developed using Unity and Photoshop. All aspects of the game (game design, programming, art work) except audio is my own.

*Playing in Firefox via the link provided will require playing in Fullscreen
